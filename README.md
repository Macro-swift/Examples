</h2>

A small, unopinionated "don't get into my way" / "I don't wanna `wait`" 
asynchronous web framework for Swift.
With a strong focus on replicating the Node APIs in Swift.
But in a typesafe, and fast way.

This repository contains examples for
[Macro.swift](https://github.com/Macro-swift/Macro).

### Running Examples as Scripts

Single file examples can be run as scripts using the
[swift-sh](https://github.com/mxcl/swift-sh),
which can be installed using a simple `brew install swift-sh`.
